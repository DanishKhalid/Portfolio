                alert("Multiplication of"  + firstNumber + " and " + secondNumber + " is " + (firstNumber * secondNumber));

    /*Division*/

                   var firstNumber1 = 13;
                   var secondNumber1 = 9;
                  alert("Division of"  + firstNumber1 + " and " + secondNumber1 + " is " + (firstNumber1 / secondNumber1));

    /*Subtraction*/

                  var firstNumber2 = 13;
                  var secondNumber2 = 9;
                  alert("Subtraction"  + firstNumber2 + " and " + secondNumber2 + " is " + (firstNumber2 - secondNumber)2);

    /*Reminder*/

                 var firstNumber3 = 13;
                 var secondNumber3 = 9;
                 alert("Reminder of"  + firstNumber3 + " and " + secondNumber3 + " is " + (firstNumber3 % secondNumber3));
